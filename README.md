# Data Structures - S3 KTU University

This repository contains various C programs related to data structures, implemented as part of the S3 (third semester) curriculum for KTU University. These programs demonstrate key concepts such as searching, stacks, queues, and more.

## Programs

1. **Binary Search** (`Binary_Search.c`)
   - Implements binary search, an efficient algorithm to find the position of a target value within a sorted array.
   
2. **Circular Queue** (`Circular_Queue.c`)
   - Demonstrates the circular queue data structure, where the last position is connected to the first to form a circle.

3. **Infix to Postfix Conversion** (`Infix_to_Postfix.c`)
   - Converts an infix expression (where operators are between operands) to a postfix expression using a stack.

4. **Linear Search** (`Linear_Search.c`)
   - A simple search algorithm that checks each element in an array sequentially to find the target.

5. **Polynomial Addition** (`Polynomial_Addition.c`)
   - Adds two polynomials using arrays, demonstrating a method for manipulating polynomials programmatically.

6. **Postfix Expression Evaluation** (`Postfix_Evaluation.c`)
   - Evaluates a postfix expression (where operators follow their operands) using a stack.

7. **Queue Implementation** (`Queue.c`)
   - Implements a basic queue data structure, allowing insertion (enqueue) and deletion (dequeue) operations.

8. **Sparse Matrix Representation** (`Sparse_Matrix.c`)
   - Implements a sparse matrix, a matrix in which most elements are zero, and performs operations on it efficiently.

9. **Stack Implementation** (`Stack.c`)
   - Implements a basic stack data structure, allowing push and pop operations, which follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO).

## How to Compile and Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AshinSMathew/S3_KTU_DATA_STRUCTURE_LAB.git
   cd S3_KTU_DATA_STRUCTURE_LAB

2. Compile any C program:
   ```bash
   gcc -o output_file program_name.c
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./output_file
