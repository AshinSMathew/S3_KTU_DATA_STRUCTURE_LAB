# Data Structures - S3 KTU University

This repository contains various C programs related to data structures, implemented as part of the S3 (third semester) curriculum for KTU University. These programs demonstrate key concepts such as searching, stacks, queues, trees, linked lists, and more.

## Programs

1. **Binary Search** (`Binary_Search.c`)
   - Implements binary search, an efficient algorithm to find the position of a target value within a sorted array.

2. **Binary Tree** (`Binary_Tree.c`)
   - Demonstrates basic operations in a binary tree data structure, including insertion, deletion, and traversal methods.

3. **Circular Queue** (`Circular_Queue.c`)
   - Demonstrates the circular queue data structure, where the last position is connected to the first to form a circle.

4. **Infix to Postfix Conversion** (`Infix_to_Postfix.c`)
   - Converts an infix expression (where operators are between operands) to a postfix expression using a stack.

5. **Linear Search** (`Linear_Search.c`)
   - A simple search algorithm that checks each element in an array sequentially to find the target.

6. **Polynomial Addition (Array)** (`Polynomial_Addition.c`)
   - Adds two polynomials using arrays, demonstrating a method for manipulating polynomials programmatically.

7. **Polynomial Addition (Linked List)** (`PolynomialAddition_LinkedList.c`)
   - Adds two polynomials using linked lists, allowing dynamic polynomial manipulation.

8. **Postfix Expression Evaluation** (`Postfix_Evaluation.c`)
   - Evaluates a postfix expression (where operators follow their operands) using a stack.

9. **Queue Implementation** (`Queue.c`)
   - Implements a basic queue data structure, allowing insertion (enqueue) and deletion (dequeue) operations.

10. **Sparse Matrix Representation** (`Sparse_Matrix.c`)
    - Implements a sparse matrix, a matrix in which most elements are zero, and performs operations on it efficiently.

11. **Stack Implementation** (`Stack.c`)
    - Implements a basic stack data structure, allowing push and pop operations, which follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO).

12. **Linked List Implementation** (`linked_list.c`)
    - Implements a singly linked list with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

13. **Sorting Algorithms** (`sorting.c`)
    - Includes common sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and possibly more, for arranging data in a specific order.
